# odin_foundations-rock-paper-scissors

This is a simple rock, paper, scissors game played against the computer. First to five wins. Infinite replayability.

I learned how to...
  use images as buttons
  add effects via transform and box-shadow
  scroll text one character at a time
  CSS animations
  hide and show elements via dom and css manipulation
